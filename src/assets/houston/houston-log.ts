Your predecessor would have set the lock and the systems in place, but she wasn't expecting to stay there long enough to harvest. However, we planned on you being able to harvest. I know that loosing some of the food stores in the storm a few days ago has changed the timeline for the harvest. However, check her notes, she should have had a minimal incubation time that would state the earliest you could access the farm and harvest without messing anything up long term. You'll find her notes in the cabinet labeled US-45-03. Please advise when you find it.",
